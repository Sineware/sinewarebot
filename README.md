## SinewareBot aka. dr. smoothie

A Discord bot with a handful of features. Originally developed as BSSCCBot 
for the Bayview Computer Club Discord server. The latest development 
version is usually running on the "[espidev's things](https://discord.gg/f2SZxU83Zr)" Discord server.

> WARNING: The bot is currently not multi-server compliant. A single SinewareBot instance only officially supports 
> one Discord server.

### Features

* Linux emulation (run Linux commands using "!linux [cmd]"). Uses [v86](https://github.com/copy/v86).
* Music Bot (run "!play [song name]" while in a VC. This kinda works)
* Chat Bot (Uses the [ChatterBot](https://chatterbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) Python chat bot library. Is trained against included data, and the Discord server chat.)
* Chat Logging (Logs all messages to a specified log channel)
* !xkcd for XKCD comics, !joke for a dad joke
* !dmoj-problem and !dmoj-user [username]
* Meme things (!fry @User, !celebrate [text] !celebrate-party [text])
* Moderation features (!admin)
* Language translation features (using [LibreTranslate](https://github.com/LibreTranslate/LibreTranslate))

### Translation
<!--The Translation service in SinewareBot allows you to create multiple channels which mirror each other, but with 
messages translated between the channels. For example:

![Channel list of #general, #general-ko, and #general-ja](docs/translation/example-channel-list.png)

When a message in English is typed into #general, it is automatically translated to Korean and Japanese:

`#general`

![English Message](docs/translation/example-original-msg.png)

`#general-ko`

![Translated Korean Message](docs/translation/example-translated-msg.png)

The bot uses Webhooks to create messages in the channel with the user's name and avatar. Translation is handled by 
LibreTranslate, which is a open source machine learning translation service you can self-host. Configuration is done 
through environment variables.

![Webhook list](docs/translation/example-webhooks.png)-->

> The mirrored translation channels feature is currently disabled for the time being.

Translation can be done on an on-demand basis in any channel by reacting to messages with üá∞üá∑ for Korean, üáØüáµ for Japanese, and 
 üá∫üá∏/üá®üá¶/üá¨üáß for English. The bot will respond with the translated message as a reply to the original.

**The system is currently a very rough prototype and proof of concept! Eventually support for more languages and customization will be added.**

### Environment Variables
The bot needs the following environment variables set:
```dotenv
BOT_TOKEN=bot token (from discord developer portal)
BOT_ID=bot id (right click the bot in discord and copy id)
CHAT_LOG_CHANNEL=channel id (where to log messages to)
CHAT_BOT_ENABLE=enables the chat bot ("true" or "false", no quotes please)
CHAT_BOT_CHANNEL=channel id (where to run the chat bot)
LINUX_VM_ENABLE=enables the linux vm ("true" or "false", no quotes please)
MOD_ADMIN_ID=ID of the initial admin user
MOD_JAIL_ROLE=ID of the role to give to jailed users (this role should disable their send messages perm for example)

TRANSLATE_ENABLE=enables the translation service ("true" or "false", no quotes please)
TRANSLATE_API=http://url (libretranslate api server)

SQL_USER=MS SQL Server user
SQL_PASSWORD=MS SQL Server password
SQL_SERVER=MS SQL Server address (ex. localhost)
SQL_DB=bssccbot (don't change this, the database will be created for you)

REDIS_SERVER=Redis address (ex. localhost)
REDIS_PORT=Redis port (ex. 6379)
```
A ".env" file can be used to set these when running locally.

#### Deploying with Docker
SinewareBot requires Microsoft SQL Server and Redis. The recommended way to deploy using docker is by using docker-compose, which 
will automatically setup a SinewareBot "bssccbot" container and MS SQL Server container, linked with a network.

First create a "docker.env" file with the above environment variables set (EXCLUDING SQL_*).

Then run `docker-compose pull && docker-compose up --no-start` to create the containers.

Finally, start the "bssccbot-mssql" container, wait for it to startup, then start the "bssccbot" container.

### SinewareBot NuAPI
NuAPI is the ongoing effort to modernize SinewareBot, in part by building it directly on the Discord API.

SinewareBot was originally built on DiscordJS v11 (which targets version 7 of the Discord API). NuAPI aims to replace 
DiscordJS in SinewareBot with its own bindings to the latest version of the Discord API.

Currently, SinewareBot employs a hybrid approach. Both NuAPI and DiscordJS exist within the project, and each maintains its 
own connection with the Discord Gateway (and makes its own REST calls). Over time, calls and event handlers are being 
migrated from DiscordJS to NuAPI.

> NuAPI/NuClient documentation is coming soon.

### Plugin Documentation:

Plugins consist of a folder in the bot-plugins directory, and an index.js file containing an init function.

**This plugin uses DiscordJS v11, make sure you are reading the correct documentation!**

Plugin Template:
```javascript
function init(client, cm, ap, nuclient) {

}

module.exports = init;

```
client -> the instance of the [DiscordJS Client](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/v11/class/Client).

cm -> the Command Mapping object

ap -> argumentParser() helper utility.

nuclient -> the instance of the SinewareBot NuAPI.

To register a command within the init function:
```javascript
cm.push({
    "command": "",
    "category": "",
    "desc": "",
    "handler": async (msg) => {

    }
});
```
Command is the command **without** the prefix. Handler is a function that is 
called when the command is invoked (with [message object](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/Message) passed to it).

Category and Description are used in the `!help` command output.

#### Argument Parser
The ap() function will return the command at index 0, and the rest of the text at index 1.
```javascript
let text = ap(msg.content)[1];
```
